(*

see of and OF 4.4.4

f.simps refers to the whole list of recursion equations defining
f. Individual facts can be selected by writing f.simps(2), whole sublists by
writing f.simps(2âˆ’4).

lemma "\<not> surj (f :: 'a \<Rightarrow> 'a set )"
proof
assume 0: "surj f"
from 0 have 1: "\<forall> A. \<exists> a. A = f a" by(simp add: surj_def)
from 1 have 2: "\<exists> a. {x . x \<notin> f x } = f a" by blast
from 2 show "False" by blast

lemma "\<not> surj (f :: 'a \<Rightarrow> 'a set )"
proof
assume "surj f"
  hence "\<exists> a. {x . x \<notin> f x } = f a" by(auto simp: surj_def)
  thus "False" by blast

lemma assumes T : "\<forall> x y. T x y \<or> T y x"
  and A:  "\<forall> x y. A x y \<and> A y x \<longrightarrow> x = y"
  and TA: "\<forall> x y. T x y \<longrightarrow> A x y"
  and A2: "A x y"
  shows "T x y"
proof -
  assume "\<not> T x y"
  from T and this have "T y x" by auto
  from TA and this have "A y x" by auto
  from this and A2 have "A x y \<and> A y x" by auto
  from this and A have "x = y" by auto
  from this and T have "T x y" by auto
  from this and `\<not> T x y` show "False" by auto
